# DeWorm App - Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the DeWorm application to ensure code quality, functionality, and maintainability.

## Testing Layers

We have implemented a multi-layered testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Focusing on individual components, functions, and utilities
2. **API Tests**: Verifying API route functionality and error handling
3. **Integration Tests**: Testing interaction between components and services
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Validating complete user flows

## Tools and Libraries

- **Vitest**: For unit, API, and integration tests
- **@testing-library/react**: For component testing
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: For DOM testing assertions
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by type and feature area:

```
/tests
  /unit
    /components     # UI component tests
    /lib            # Utility function tests
    /api            # API route tests
  /e2e              # End-to-end tests
  /test-results     # Test output and reports
```

## Testing Practices

### Component Testing

- Test rendering, props, state changes, and user interactions
- Mock external dependencies and context providers
- Verify accessibility where applicable
- Test both happy paths and error states

Example (CookieConsent.test.tsx):

```typescript
it("should render the cookie consent banner when consent is not given", () => {
  render(<CookieConsent />);

  expect(screen.getByText("Cookie Policy")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Accept" })).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### API Route Testing

- Test input validation and required parameters
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test successful responses and error handling
- Mock external service dependencies

Example (spotify-search.test.ts):

```typescript
it("should return 400 if query parameter is missing", async () => {
  const request = new NextRequest("http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/search");
  const response = await GET(request);

  expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  const body = await response.json();
  expect(body.error).toBe('Query parameter "q" is required');
});
```

### Utility Function Testing

- Test input validation and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (DB, API clients)
- Verify error handling

### End-to-End Testing

- Test complete user flows from start to finish
- Verify UI interactions work as expected
- Test across different device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Example (landing.spec.ts):

```typescript
test("should display the cookie consent banner", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");

  const cookieConsent = page.getByText("Cookie Policy");
  await expect(cookieConsent).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Components**: 90%+ coverage
- **API Routes**: 95%+ coverage
- **Utility Functions**: 95%+ coverage
- **Critical User Flows**: 100% E2E test coverage

## Continuous Integration

All tests should be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Unit/Component/API tests run on all PRs and commits
2. E2E tests run before deployment to production

## Test Maintenance

- Tests should be updated whenever related code changes
- Dead or redundant tests should be removed
- Test coverage reports will be generated regularly
- All new features should include appropriate tests

## Future Improvements

- Add visual regression testing
- Implement performance testing
- Add load/stress testing for critical API endpoints
- Automated accessibility testing
